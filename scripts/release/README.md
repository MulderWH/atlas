## How to release widgets & modules to the appstore (`./marketplaceRelease.js`)

#### Web Widgets
1. Create a release in GitHub
1. Add a tag to the commit you want to create a release from. The tag should be formatted like ${PackageName}-v${Major}.${Minor}.${Patch}
    - Example: `maps-web-v2.0.2`
1. That's it! 
    - The content should now be released in GitHub.
    - The content should now be released in the MX Marketplace. Double check to verify.

#### Web Modules
1. Add a tag to the commit you want to create a release from. The tag should be formatted like ${PackageName}-v${Major}.${Minor}.${Patch}
    - Example: `nanoflow-actions-web-v2.0.0`
1. That's it! 
    - The content should now be released in GitHub.
    - The content should now be released in the MX Marketplace. Double check to verify.

#### Atlas Core
2. Trigger the "Create Web Release" action manually in GitHub with the argument "atlas-core".
3. That's it!
    - The content should now be released in GitHub as a draft. Approve and publish it.
    - Then another GitHub action `MarketplaceRelease` will take care of releasing the module to the MX Marketplace. Double check to verify.

#### Native Modules
1. Make sure a new widget is used on a page in the module and commit your changes, so it's included in the module when it's exported (Note: I'm not convinced this is necessary anymore. Someone please verify).
1. Make sure each changed widget has an appropriate change to it's `package.json` & `package.xml` (version bump) and changelog before releasing.
1. Each widget or module's `minimumMXVersion` (in package.json) should match the Mendix project (`NativeComponentsTestProject`) Studio Pro version.
1. Add a tag to the commit you want to create a release from. The tag should be formatted like ${PackageName}-v${Major}.${Minor}.${Patch}. Push this tag to GitHub, this will trigger a GitHub action.
    - Example: `mobile-resources-native-v3.0.0`
    - Example: `nanoflow-actions-native-v3.0.0`
1. That's it! 
    - The content should now be released in GitHub.
    - The content should now be released in the MX Marketplace. Double check to verify.
